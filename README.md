# Django cradmin

Django custom role based admin UI.

Django cradmin is in BETA. The system is fairly stable, but:

- We do not have getting started guides.
- We should have better tests before release. Some parts have been prototyped
  a lot while we tested out different concepts, and they need a complexity
  review and better tests.
- Works with Django 4 and python >=3.8,<3.11

## Develop
Requires:
- https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv


### Use conventional commits for GIT commit messages
See https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/.
You can use this git commit message format in many different ways, but the easiest is:

- Use commitizen: https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/commit/
- Use an editor extension, like https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vivaxy.vscode-conventional-commits for VScode.
- Just learn to write the format by hand (can be error prone to begin with, but it is fairly easy to learn).


### Install hatch and commitizen
NOTE: You only need hatch if you need to build releases, and you
only need commitizen for releases OR to make it easy to follow
conventional commits for your commit messages
(see _Use conventional commits for GIT commit messages_ above).

First install pipx with:
```bash
brew install pipx
pipx ensurepath
```

Then install hatch and commitizen:
```bash
pipx install hatch 
pipx install commitizen
```

See https://github.com/pypa/pipx, https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/install/
and https://commitizen-tools.github.io/commitizen/ for more install alternatives if
needed, but we really recommend using pipx since that is isolated.


### Install development dependencies

Install a local python version with pyenv:
```bash
pyenv install 3.10
pyenv local 3.10
```

#### Create virtualenv
```bash
./tools/recreate-virtualenv.sh
```

> Alternatively, create virtualenv manually (this does the same as recreate-virtualenv.sh):
> ```bash
> python -m venv .venv
> ```
> the ./tools/recreate-virtualenv.sh script is just here to make creating virtualenvs more uniform
> across different repos because some repos will require extra setup in the virtualenv
> for package authentication etc.

#### Install dependencies
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev, test]"
```

### Run dev server
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate   # enable virtualenv
ievv devrun
```

### Run tests
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate   # enable virtualenv
pytest django_cradmin
```

*******************
UIcontainer and BEM
*******************
We use BEM syntax for the cradmin CSS, and we have designed
the uicontainer library with built in support for
working with BEM.

This does not mean that you are forced to use BEM with uicontainer,
it simly means that we have some shortcuts/convenience stuff
that makes using BEM natural and easy.

More information about BEM at http://getbem.com/.
